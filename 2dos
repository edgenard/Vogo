see also TODOs in code

small features
	auto-select newly created commands
	indicateIfInsideAnySelectedCommandsScope on hover
	improve function call look -> context menu for args
	handling endless recursion by checking line-length or out of bounds
	show results of expressions beneath input field "=..."
	more tooltips, more sanity checks
	cycle (select) through elements (as in code) with arrow keys
	simple! Embedding of results in web pages (should remain dynamic)
	add acknowledgements (back to me)
	add switch for add before or after selected element
	if loop is set to an array, automatically detect this and iterate over length
	one selected element can contain another selected element - fix?!
		is this creating bugs when removeDeselectAndDeleteAllCompletely ?

performance
	further cache arguments eval
	for one run cycle and the same stack position, only evaluate variables once
	store which expression requires which variables, so I only eval those
	put svg styles in svg css (inkscape compatibility?)
	round dom numbers

big features
	### upload results to server/community results page
		also export viewport properties
		define API
		serverside exchange method
		clientside browse and import
		clientside code-based import
		clientside share
	### automatic tests
	store history in local browser cache
	examples and tutorial videos/help
	edit Move style (colour, breadth)
	close path command
		edit fill
	new command: goto, go home, go to point in past
	add svg-native circle/arc
	constraint solving
		snapping/line end handles
	Collision-Free positioning
		check same state of commands, then shift y ?
	bigger click radius, especially for Move
	variables can reference variables (on global scope)
	How can the program flow be visualised (stepping through)?
		Map a parameter to space (show multiple "shadow instances" of it)
	selection z-order-handling (ALT selects below)
		this is actually hard, because event propagation will not work
		I will need to manually compute which elements a click hit

	allow functions as arguments
	undo
	Beziers
	Bearbeitung von geschlossenen Pfaden (FÃ¼llung, ...)
	allow much more dragging between elements
	code ui view
	Logo output

bugs
	foreignObject relative width and height
	code output: loop has one tab indentation too much (may also apply to other code)
	fix: rotation/move manipulation in loop: so that line crosses mouse
	rotate/move/loop with 0 is non-selectable/visible
	remove loops when empty (e.g. removed last inner command)
	if an Expression is set to say Math.random(), it is considered static because it does not depend on arguments
	2 subsequent moves cannot be distinguished
	chromium only (chrome works): the input fields inside foreign objects do not update
	function name input field has no drag event, but selections via mouse is disabled
