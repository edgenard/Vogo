small features
	### angles in degrees
	### hide duplicate expressions (in loops or recursion)
		simplification of visual steps (with increased number of steps)
	### mark all commands in selected scope
	pointer to hand for dragging canvas
	cursor to right-left arrow on input field
	improve function call look -> context menu for args
	direct creation of variables ("a" also works if nothing is selected)
	hide function call interna
		How can a function call be "inlined" into the current context (stepping down into its definition, maintaining context)?
	handling endless recursion by checking line-length or out of bounds
	new command: goto, go home, go to point in past, close path
	rotate icon arc radius is limited by subsequent line length (no overshoot)
	adjust existing line length by select + d
	selection
		### select with rect
		copy and paste selection
		move selection
		z-order-handling
	show results of expressions beneath input field "=..."
	more tooltips, more sanity checks
	variables can reference variables (on global scope)
	cycle (select) through elements (as in code) with arrow keys
	simple! Embedding of results in web pages (should remain dynamic)
	add acknowledgements (back to me)

performance
	for one run cycle and the same stack position, only evaluate variables once
	store which expression requires which variables, so I only eval those
	put svg styles in svg css (inkscape compatibility?)
	round dom numbers

big features
	### hotkeys sidebar
	### automatic tests (adjust for testability)
	constraint solving
		snapping/line end handles
	Collision-Free positioning
		check same state of commands, then shift y ?
	How can the program flow be visualised (stepping through)?
		Map a parameter to space (show multiple "shadow instances" of it)
	Logo output
	edit lines (colour, breadth)
	allow functions as arguments
	undo
	Beziers
	Bearbeitung von geschlossenen Pfaden (FÃ¼llung, ...)
	allow much more dragging between elements

bugs
	### add proxies to functions (debug dependency checking) and improve run() performance
	if recursing, fc with a and b, setting both to be a|b*0.9 will create an endless loop
		this is caused by the fact that to eval a, a and be are needed, creating a tree of evals, which explodes
	foreignObject relative width and height
	fix: rotation manipulation in loop: so that line crosses mouse
	rotate/move/loop with 0 is non-selectable/visible
	svg output does not work (input tag error)
	chrome fix input field text select not visible
	remove loops when empty (e.g. removed last inner command)
	allow white spaces in variable definition "a = 3"
	2 subsequent moves cannot be distinguished
	abstracting over selected element inside a functionCall creates errors
