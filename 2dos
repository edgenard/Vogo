see also TODOs in code

small features
	export to code TO ui output window
	indicateIfInsideAnySelectedCommandsScope on hover
	improve function call look -> context menu for args
	handling endless recursion by checking line-length or out of bounds
	show results of expressions beneath input field "=..."
	more tooltips, more sanity checks
	cycle (select) through elements (as in code) with arrow keys
	simple! Embedding of results in web pages (should remain dynamic)
	add acknowledgements (back to me)
	if loop is set to an array, automatically detect this and iterate over length
	one selected element can contain another selected element - fix?!
		is this creating bugs when removeDeselectAndDeleteAllCompletely ?

performance
	further cache arguments eval
	for one run cycle and the same stack position, only evaluate variables once
	store which expression requires which variables, so I only eval those
	put svg styles in svg css (inkscape compatibility?)
	round dom numbers

big features
	### automatic tests
	upload results to server/community results page
	examples and tutorial videos/help
	new command: goto, go home, go to point in past, close path
	constraint solving
		snapping/line end handles
	Collision-Free positioning
		check same state of commands, then shift y ?
	bigger click radius, especially for Move
	variables can reference variables (on global scope)
	How can the program flow be visualised (stepping through)?
		Map a parameter to space (show multiple "shadow instances" of it)
	Logo output
	selection z-order-handling (ALT selects below)
		this is actually hard, because event propagation will not work
		I will need to manually compute which elements a click hit

	edit lines (colour, breadth)
	allow functions as arguments
	undo
	Beziers
	Bearbeitung von geschlossenen Pfaden (FÃ¼llung, ...)
	allow much more dragging between elements
	code ui view

bugs
	### add proxies to functions (debug dependency checking) and improve run() performance
	foreignObject relative width and height
	svg output does not work (input tag error)
	fix: rotation/move manipulation in loop: so that line crosses mouse
	rotate/move/loop with 0 is non-selectable/visible
	remove loops when empty (e.g. removed last inner command)
	2 subsequent moves cannot be distinguished
	chromium only (chrome works): the input fields inside foreign objects do not update
