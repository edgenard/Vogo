### MA release version
	tutorial videos/help
		text
	test, test, test
	github upload
		clean git
	email Bret & Toby :)

### community
	upload results to server/community results page
		adapt API to allow import to UI
		define & document API
			improve compiler scheme image
		clientside code-based import & export
			what is "common" for code and ui
			version check
		serverside exchange method
		clientside browse and import
		clientside share
	show examples

small features
	funcCall: make result of arg visible as text field on hover of arg
	funcCall: make it visible (at least the "f") when it is a proxy>1
	remove Â° if edit in input field (rotate)
	more tooltips, more sanity checks
	auto-select newly created commands
	indicateIfInsideAnySelectedCommandsScope on hover
	improve function call look -> context menu for args
	handling endless recursion by checking line-length or out of bounds
	show results of expressions beneath input field "=..."
	cycle (select) through elements (as in code) with arrow keys
	add switch for add before or after selected element
	if loop is set to an array, automatically detect this and iterate over length
	manipulation preview has different style (e.g. lower opacity)
	one selected element can contain another selected element - fix?!
		is this creating bugs when removeDeselectAndDeleteAllCompletely ?

big features
	automatic tests
	edit Move style (colour, breadth)
	close path command
		edit fill
	Collision-Free positioning
		check same state of commands, then shift y ?
	new command: goto, go home, go to point in past
		go back X states in time
	store history in local browser cache
	add svg-native circle/arc
	constraint solving
		snapping/line end handles
	bigger click radius, especially for Move
	variables can reference variables (on global scope)
	How can the program flow be visualised (stepping through)?
		Map a parameter to space (show multiple "shadow instances" of it)
	selection z-order-handling (ALT selects below)
		this is actually hard, because event propagation will not work
		I will need to manually compute which elements a click hit
		http://mozilla.6506.n7.nabble.com/Event-Bubbling-through-Layers-td247852.html
	allow functions as arguments
	undo
	Beziers
	store session in local browser cache
	allow much more dragging between elements
	code ui view/codemirror
	Logo output

performance
	make recursion depth depend on run execution time
	further cache arguments eval
	for one run cycle and the same stack position, only evaluate variables once
	store which expression requires which variables, so I only eval those
	put svg styles in svg css (inkscape compatibility?)
	round dom numbers

bugs
	drawing of loop icons may fail (see pieChart example)
	deleting a recursing funcCall does not seem to work smoothly
	a rename parameter is not removed from funcCall args list
	fix: rotation/move manipulation in loop: so that line crosses mouse
	rotate/move/loop with 0 is non-selectable/visible
	remove loops when empty (e.g. removed last inner command)
	if an Expression is set to say Math.random(), it is considered static because it does not depend on arguments
	2 subsequent moves cannot be distinguished
	chromium only (chrome works): the input fields inside foreign objects do not update
	function name (& branch cond) input field has no drag event, but selections via mouse is disabled
